A Terms & Conditions document for a website is an agreement the website makes 
with its users about how to use the application properly, as well as the 
obligations and responsibilities of each party. Apps, especially commercial apps, 
have a portion of the site devoted to Terms & Conditions because it's the most important 
document for letting app users know what is expected of them.

One of the primary functions of a Terms & Conditions document is to outline what 
will happen in a variety of different possible situations, including if the user breaks 
the rules and must have his/her account terminated. If the user goes in knowing what to expect, 
it is less likely that there will be problems between the user and the app down the road.

The Terms & Conditions document on any website creates a legally binding set of rules 
for the user, as well as, in most cases, the website owner. It's a place to set up expectations 
for each of the parties and ensure that the use of the app runs smoothly for both.
